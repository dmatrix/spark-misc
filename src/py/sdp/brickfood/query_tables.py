# Function to query the materialized view and return a DataFrame
# This function reads from the specified database and returns a DataFrame with order items.
# The DataFrame can be further processed or analyzed as needed.

# The DataFrame will contain columns such as order_id, order_item, price, etc.
# The function can also include filtering or selecting specific columns as needed.
# The DataFrame returned by this function can be used for further analysis or processing.
