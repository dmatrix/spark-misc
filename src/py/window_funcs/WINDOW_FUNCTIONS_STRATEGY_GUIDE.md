# PySpark Window Functions: Strategy Selection Guide

When faced with analytical challenges in PySpark, choosing the right window function approach can make the difference between a sluggish query and lightning-fast insights. This comprehensive strategy guide helps you navigate the six essential window function patterns and select the optimal approach for your specific business scenario.

## 🎯 The Decision Framework

Before diving into specific techniques, ask yourself these key questions:

1. **What is your primary analytical goal?** (Performance ranking, trend analysis, comparative analysis, etc.)
2. **What is your data's time dimension?** (Daily transactions, monthly aggregates, real-time streams)
3. **Do you need to compare current values with historical data?** (Yesterday vs today, quarter-over-quarter)
4. **Are you looking for absolute values or relative positions?** (Top sales amount vs top 10%)
5. **Do you need cumulative insights or period-specific calculations?** (Running totals vs monthly averages)

## 🚀 Quick Strategy Selector

### 📊 **Scenario: "I need to identify top performers and handle ties appropriately"**

**Business Context**: Performance reviews, bonus calculations, leaderboards, tournament rankings

**Recommended Approach**: **Ranking Operations**
- **Primary Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- **Key Strength**: Sophisticated tie-handling with three distinct methodologies
- **Demo File**: `ranking_operations_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic choice based on tie-handling needs:
# ROW_NUMBER() - Always unique ranks (performance bonuses)
# RANK() - Skip ranks after ties (academic grading)  
# DENSE_RANK() - No gaps in ranks (competitive rankings)
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ You have clearly defined performance metrics
- ✅ Tie-breaking rules are important for fairness
- ✅ You need both regional and global rankings
- ✅ Results will be used for compensation or recognition

---

### 📈 **Scenario: "I need to track progress over time without losing transaction detail"**

**Business Context**: Financial reporting, YTD tracking, quota monitoring, KPI dashboards

**Recommended Approach**: **Running Aggregations**
- **Primary Functions**: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()` with window frames
- **Key Strength**: Maintains transaction-level detail while adding cumulative context
- **Demo File**: `aggregation_window_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic window frame selection:
# Unbounded frame - From start to current (YTD totals)
# Bounded frame - Last N periods (rolling 3-month average)
# Range frame - Based on value ranges (price bands)
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ You need both detailed transactions AND cumulative metrics
- ✅ Regulatory reporting requires audit trails
- ✅ Business users need progress tracking dashboards
- ✅ You're building financial or operational scorecards

---

### 🔄 **Scenario: "I need to compare current values with previous/future periods"**

**Business Context**: Stock price analysis, growth rate calculations, trend detection, seasonality analysis

**Recommended Approach**: **Lead/Lag Operations**
- **Primary Functions**: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`
- **Key Strength**: Time-series analysis without complex self-joins
- **Demo File**: `lead_lag_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic temporal analysis patterns:
# LAG() - Compare with previous periods (growth rates)
# LEAD() - Compare with future periods (forecasting)
# Multiple offsets - Compare with N periods ago/ahead
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ Your analysis is fundamentally time-based
- ✅ You need to calculate period-over-period changes
- ✅ Growth rates and trend directions are critical
- ✅ You're building trading algorithms or forecasting models

---

### 📊 **Scenario: "I need to smooth out volatility and identify genuine trends"**

**Business Context**: Performance monitoring, seasonal adjustment, noise reduction, trend analysis

**Recommended Approach**: **Moving Averages**
- **Primary Functions**: `AVG()` with rolling window frames
- **Key Strength**: Noise reduction while preserving underlying patterns
- **Demo File**: `moving_averages_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic smoothing approaches:
# Short windows (3-7 periods) - Responsive to recent changes
# Medium windows (10-30 periods) - Balance responsiveness and stability
# Long windows (50+ periods) - Long-term trend identification
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ Your raw data is too volatile for direct analysis
- ✅ You need to distinguish signal from noise
- ✅ Business users need trend confirmation
- ✅ You're monitoring performance against targets

---

### 📊 **Scenario: "I need to understand relative positions and create fair distributions"**

**Business Context**: Salary analysis, performance distributions, risk assessment, market positioning

**Recommended Approach**: **Percentile Analysis**
- **Primary Functions**: `PERCENT_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `CUME_DIST()`
- **Key Strength**: Transforms absolute values into meaningful relative positions
- **Demo File**: `percentile_analysis_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic distribution analysis:
# PERCENT_RANK() - Exact percentile positions (0-100%)
# NTILE() - Equal-sized groups (quartiles, quintiles)
# CUME_DIST() - Cumulative distribution (statistical analysis)
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ Absolute values are less meaningful than relative positions
- ✅ You need equitable grouping or classification
- ✅ Compensation analysis requires market positioning
- ✅ You're identifying outliers or exceptions

---

### 🎯 **Scenario: "I need to analyze customer journeys and attribute success"**

**Business Context**: Customer acquisition analysis, marketing attribution, lifecycle tracking, conversion analysis

**Recommended Approach**: **First/Last Value Analysis**
- **Primary Functions**: `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`
- **Key Strength**: Captures customer journey endpoints for attribution
- **Demo File**: `first_last_value_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic journey analysis patterns:
# FIRST_VALUE() - Acquisition attribution (first touch)
# LAST_VALUE() - Conversion attribution (last touch)
# Window frames - Control which interactions are considered
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ Customer acquisition cost and attribution are critical
- ✅ You need to understand conversion pathways
- ✅ Marketing channel effectiveness requires measurement
- ✅ Customer lifetime value calculations are needed

## 🔧 Advanced Strategy Combinations

### **Multi-Function Strategies for Complex Analysis**

Often, real-world scenarios require combining multiple window function approaches:

#### **Comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis**
```python
# Combine ranking + aggregation + moving averages
df_comprehensive = (df
    .withColumn("sales_rank", dense_rank().over(regional_window))
    .withColumn("ytd_sales", sum("amount").over(ytd_window))
    .withColumn("trend_direction", 
                when(col("ma_30_day") > lag("ma_30_day", 1).over(time_window), "UP")
                .otherwise("DOWN")))
```

#### **Customer Journey with Performance Benchmarking**
```python
# Combine first/last values + percentiles + lag analysis
df_customer_analysis = (df
    .withColumn("first_channel", first_value("channel").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("clv_percentile", percent_rank().over(clv_window))
    .withColumn("engagement_change", 
                col("current_engagement") - lag("engagement", 1).over(time_window)))
```

## 🚦 Performance Optimization Strategies

### **Data Volume Considerations**

#### **Small to Medium Data (< 1TB)**
- **Strategy**: Prioritize readability and maintainability
- **Approach**: Use any window function combination
- **Focus**: Business logic correctness over performance optimization

#### **Large Data (1TB - 10TB)**
- **Strategy**: Optimize partitioning and window specifications
- **Approach**: Carefully tune `partitionBy()` clauses
- **Focus**: Balance between functionality and execution time

#### **Very Large Data (> 10TB)**
- **Strategy**: Consider pre-aggregation and incremental processing
- **Approach**: Break complex window operations into stages
- **Focus**: Scalability and resource management

### **Query Performance Optimization**

```python
# Performance-optimized window specifications
# Good: Partition by commonly filtered columns
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("region", "product_category").orderBy("date")

# Better: Add explicit frame boundaries when possible
bounded_window = (Window.partitionBy("customer_id")
                        .orderBy("transaction_date")
                        .rowsBetween(-30, Window.currentRow))

# Best: Use range frames for time-based windows
time_window = (Window.partitionBy("store_id")
                     .orderBy(col("date").cast("long"))
                     .rangeBetween(-86400 * 7, 0))  # 7 days in seconds
```

## 🎓 Strategy Implementation Patterns

### **Pattern 1: The Progressive Analysis**
Start simple, add complexity gradually:

```python
# Step 1: Basic ranking
df_step1 = df.withColumn("rank", rank().over(basic_window))

# Step 2: Add running totals
df_step2 = df_step1.withColumn("running_total", sum("amount").over(cumulative_window))

# Step 3: Add trend analysis
df_final = df_step2.withColumn("trend", 
                               when(col("running_total") > lag("running_total", 7).over(time_window), "Growing")
                               .otherwise("Declining"))
```

### **Pattern 2: The Comparative Analysis**
Build comprehensive comparisons:

```python
# Multi-dimensional comparison strategy
df_comparison = (df
    .withColumn("rank_current_period", rank().over(current_window))
    .withColumn("rank_previous_period", rank().over(previous_window))
    .withColumn("percentile_company", percent_rank().over(company_window))
    .withColumn("percentile_industry", percent_rank().over(industry_window)))
```

### **Pattern 3: The Journey Analysis**
Track entities over time:

```python
# Complete journey tracking strategy
df_journey = (df
    .withColumn("first_interaction", first_value("touchpoint").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("last_interaction", last_value("touchpoint").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("interaction_count", count("*").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("days_active", 
                datediff(last_value("date").over(customer_window),
                        first_value("date").over(customer_window))))
```
