# PySpark Window Functions: Strategy Selection Guide

When faced with analytical challenges in PySpark, choosing the right window function approach can make the difference between slow and fast query execution. This comprehensive strategy guide helps you navigate the six essential window function patterns and select the optimal approach for your specific business scenario.

## 🎯 The Decision Framework

Before diving into specific techniques, ask yourself these key questions:

1. **What is your primary analytical goal?** (Performance ranking, trend analysis, comparative analysis, etc.)
2. **What is your data's time dimension?** (Daily transactions, monthly aggregates, real-time streams)
3. **Do you need to compare current values with historical data?** (Yesterday vs today, quarter-over-quarter)
4. **Are you looking for absolute values or relative positions?** (Top sales amount vs top 10%)
5. **Do you need cumulative insights or period-specific calculations?** (Running totals vs monthly averages)

## 🚀 Strategy Selector

### 📊 **Scenario: "I need to identify top performers and handle ties appropriately"**

**Business Context**: Performance reviews, bonus calculations, leaderboards, tournament rankings

**Recommended Approach**: **Ranking Operations**
- **Primary Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- **Key Strength**: Sophisticated tie-handling with three distinct methodologies
- **Demo File**: `ranking_operations_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic choice based on tie-handling needs:
# ROW_NUMBER() - Always unique ranks (performance bonuses)
# RANK() - Skip ranks after ties (academic grading)  
# DENSE_RANK() - No gaps in ranks (competitive rankings)
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ You have clearly defined performance metrics
- ✅ Tie-breaking rules are important for fairness
- ✅ You need both regional and global rankings
- ✅ Results will be used for compensation or recognition

---

### 📈 **Scenario: "I need to track progress over time without losing transaction detail"**

**Business Context**: Financial reporting, YTD tracking, quota monitoring, KPI dashboards

**Recommended Approach**: **Running Aggregations**
- **Primary Functions**: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()` with window frames
- **Key Strength**: Maintains transaction-level detail while adding cumulative context
- **Demo File**: `aggregation_window_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic window frame selection:
# Unbounded frame - From start to current (YTD totals)
# Bounded frame - Last N periods (rolling 3-month average)
# Range frame - Based on value ranges (price bands)
```

**When to Choose This Strategy**:
- ✅ You need both detailed transactions AND cumulative metrics
- ✅ Regulatory reporting requires audit trails
- ✅ Business users need progress tracking dashboards
- ✅ You're building financial or operational scorecards

---

### 🔄 **Scenario: "I need to compare current values with previous/future periods"**

**Business Context**: Stock price analysis, growth rate calculations, trend detection, seasonality analysis

**Recommended Approach**: **Lead/Lag Operations**
- **Primary Functions**: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`
- **Key Strength**: Time-series analysis without complex self-joins
- **Demo File**: `lead_lag_demo.py`

```python
# Strategic temporal analysis patterns:
# LAG() - Compare with previous periods (growth rates)

## 🔧 Advanced Strategy Combinations

### **Multi-Function Strategies for Complex Analysis**

Often, real-world scenarios require combining multiple window function approaches:

#### **Comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis**
```python
# Combine ranking + aggregation + moving averages
df_comprehensive = (df
    .withColumn("sales_rank", dense_rank().over(regional_window))
    .withColumn("ytd_sales", sum("amount").over(ytd_window))
    .withColumn("trend_direction", 
                when(col("ma_30_day") > lag("ma_30_day", 1).over(time_window), "UP")
                .otherwise("DOWN")))
```

#### **Customer Journey with Performance Benchmarking**
```python
# Combine first/last values + percentiles + lag analysis
df_customer_analysis = (df
    .withColumn("first_channel", first_value("channel").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("clv_percentile", percent_rank().over(clv_window))
    .withColumn("engagement_change", 
                col("current_engagement") - lag("engagement", 1).over(time_window)))
```

## 🚦 Performance Optimization Strategies

### **Spark Connect Architecture Considerations (PySpark 4.0)**

With PySpark 4.0's Spark Connect, your application runs as a **thin client** that communicates with a remote Spark server via gRPC. This client-server architecture impacts window function performance in several ways:

#### **Client-Server Communication Benefits**
- **Resource Efficiency**: Client applications consume ~200MB memory vs ~1.5GB for traditional Spark drivers
- **Improved Executor Utilization**: Multiple client applications can share executor resources dynamically
- **Isolation**: Client failures don't impact the shared Spark server or other applications
- **Reduced Startup Time**: Server is pre-warmed and ready to accept requests

#### **Performance Considerations for Window Functions**
- **Server-Side Execution**: Window functions still execute on the server, preserving all Spark optimizations
- **Network Overhead**: Results are streamed back via Apache Arrow, minimizing serialization costs
- **Logical Plan Transfer**: DataFrame operations are sent as lightweight logical plans, not data

### **Data Volume Considerations**

#### **Small to Medium Data (< 1TB)**
- **Strategy**: Use Spark Connect for reduced resource footprint
- **Approach**: Use any window function combination; client overhead is minimal
- **Focus**: Business logic correctness over performance optimization
- **Spark Connect Advantage**: Reduced memory usage and improved application startup time

#### **Large Data (1TB - 10TB)**
- **Strategy**: Optimize partitioning and window specifications
- **Approach**: Carefully tune `partitionBy()` clauses; server-side execution unchanged
- **Focus**: Balance between functionality and execution time
- **Spark Connect Consideration**: Network latency negligible for large result sets

#### **Very Large Data (> 10TB)**
- **Strategy**: Consider pre-aggregation and incremental processing
- **Approach**: Break complex window operations into stages
- **Focus**: Scalability and resource management
- **Spark Connect Note**: Heavy workloads may benefit from traditional Spark applications for specialized configurations

### **Query Performance Optimization**

```python
# Performance-optimized window specifications
# Good: Partition by commonly filtered columns
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("region", "product_category").orderBy("date")

# Better: Add explicit frame boundaries when possible
bounded_window = (Window.partitionBy("customer_id")
                        .orderBy("transaction_date")
                        .rowsBetween(-30, Window.currentRow))

# Best: Use range frames for time-based windows
time_window = (Window.partitionBy("store_id")
                     .orderBy(col("date").cast("long"))
                     .rangeBetween(-86400 * 7, 0))  # 7 days in seconds
```

## 🎓 Strategy Implementation Patterns

### **Pattern 1: The Progressive Analysis**
Start simple, add complexity gradually:

```python
# Step 1: Basic ranking
df_step1 = df.withColumn("rank", rank().over(basic_window))

# Step 2: Add running totals
df_step2 = df_step1.withColumn("running_total", sum("amount").over(cumulative_window))

# Step 3: Add trend analysis
df_final = df_step2.withColumn("trend", 
                               when(col("running_total") > lag("running_total", 7).over(time_window), "Growing")
                               .otherwise("Declining"))
```

### **Pattern 2: The Comparative Analysis**
Build comprehensive comparisons:

```python
# Multi-dimensional comparison strategy
df_comparison = (df
    .withColumn("rank_current_period", rank().over(current_window))
    .withColumn("rank_previous_period", rank().over(previous_window))
    .withColumn("percentile_company", percent_rank().over(company_window))
    .withColumn("percentile_industry", percent_rank().over(industry_window)))
```

### **Pattern 3: The Journey Analysis**
Track entities over time:

```python
# Complete journey tracking strategy
df_journey = (df
    .withColumn("first_interaction", first_value("touchpoint").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("last_interaction", last_value("touchpoint").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("interaction_count", count("*").over(customer_window))
    .withColumn("days_active", 
                datediff(last_value("date").over(customer_window),
                        first_value("date").over(customer_window))))
```

## 🔍 Debugging and Troubleshooting Strategies

### **Common Strategy Selection Mistakes**

1. **Over-Engineering**: Using complex combinations when simple solutions suffice
