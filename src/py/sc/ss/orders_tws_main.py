"""
Main execution module for the Retail Order Tracking System.

This module provides the main entry point for running the retail order tracking system.
It demonstrates how to start and run the order tracking system with proper error handling
and graceful shutdown capabilities.

The module integrates the OrderTrackingProcessor with utility functions to create
a complete streaming application that processes order events in real-time.

Usage:
    python orders_tws_main.py

Features:
    - Graceful startup and shutdown handling
    - Keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Integration with Spark streaming infrastructure
