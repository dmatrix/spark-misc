```bash
# See it in action  
python learn_main.py
```

## 📖 How to Use This Learning Guide

### 🎯 **Step-by-Step Learning Path**

**⏱️ Total Time: 15-30 minutes**

#### **Phase 1: See It Working (5 minutes)**
1. **Run the demo first** - Don't read code yet!
   ```bash
   python learn_main.py
   ```
2. **Watch the output** - Notice these key patterns:
   - Same flight names appear in multiple batches
   - `update_count` increases over time for each flight
   - States progress: `boarding → flying → landed → boarding`
   - **This is state persistence in action!**

3. **Stop with Ctrl+C** when you see the pattern

#### **Phase 2: Understand the Concept (5 minutes)**
4. **Read the core concept** (Section: "🧠 Core Concept: The Notebook Metaphor")
5. **Follow one flight's journey** - Run again and track just Delta1247:
   ```
   Delta1247: boarding (update #1)
   Delta1247: flying (update #2)  
   Delta1247: landed (update #3)
   Delta1247: boarding (update #4)  ← Back to start!
   ```

#### **Phase 3: Explore the Code (10 minutes)**
6. **Start with the processor** - Open `learn_tws.py`:
   - Look at the `FlightProcessor` class
   - Find the `handleInputRows` method
   - See how state is loaded and saved with JSON

7. **Check the data generation** - Open `learn_util.py`:
   - Find `create_flight_data` function
   - See how 3 flights cycle through states

8. **Understand the main flow** - Open `learn_main.py`:
   - Simple entry point that ties everything together

#### **Phase 4: Experiment (5-10 minutes)**
9. **Modify and test** - Try these changes:
   - Change flight names in `learn_util.py`
   - Add a 4th state in the progression
   - Modify the cycle timing

10. **Run your changes** and see the results!

### 🎓 **Learning Verification Checklist**

After completing the guide, you should be able to:
- [ ] **Explain state persistence**: Why does `update_count` increase?
- [ ] **Identify the key concept**: What makes each flight independent?
- [ ] **Understand the API**: What does `transformWithStateInPandas` do?
- [ ] **Recognize the pattern**: How does `groupBy("flight")` work?
- [ ] **See the lifecycle**: What happens in `handleInputRows`?

### 🔍 **What to Focus On While Learning**

#### **👀 Watch For These Patterns:**
1. **State Survival**: Same flight appears in different batches with increasing counts
2. **Independent Processing**: Each flight (Delta1247, United892, Southwest5031) has separate state
3. **Automatic Progression**: States advance predictably regardless of input
4. **JSON Serialization**: Complex state stored as simple strings

#### **🧠 Key Mental Models:**
1. **The Notebook Metaphor**: Each flight has its own persistent notebook
2. **Batch Processing**: Each batch processes multiple flights independently  
3. **State Store**: RocksDB keeps the "notebooks" safe between batches
4. **Grouping**: `groupBy("flight")` ensures each flight gets its own processor

### 🚨 **Common Learning Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Don't read all the code first** - Run it and see it working!
2. **Don't focus on RocksDB details** - Focus on the state persistence concept
3. **Don't worry about the warnings** - They're normal and don't affect learning
4. **Don't try to understand everything** - Focus on the core pattern

### 💡 **Pro Learning Tips**

1. **Run multiple times** - Each run helps reinforce the concepts
2. **Follow one flight** - Pick Delta1247 and track its journey
3. **Count the updates** - Notice how state persists and grows
4. **Think "notebook per flight"** - This mental model is key
5. **Experiment freely** - The code is designed to be modified!

## 🧠 Core Concept: The Notebook Metaphor

Think of `transformWithState` like having a **notebook for each flight**:

```
📔 Delta1247 Notebook     📔 United892 Notebook     📔 Southwest5031 Notebook
   Current: boarding         Current: flying          Current: landed
   Updates: 1                Updates: 3               Updates: 2
```

Every streaming batch:
1. **Look up** the flight's notebook page
2. **Read** what state it was in  
3. **Update** based on new information
4. **Write** the new state back
5. **Notebook persists** for next batch!

## 🔍 What Happens Step by Step

### Batch 1: New Flights Arrive
```
Input:  Delta1247 → boarding
Process: "New flight! Starting notebook for Delta1247"
State:  Delta1247 = {state: "boarding", updates: 1}
Output: Delta1247 is boarding (1 update)
```

### Batch 2: More Updates
```
Input:  United892 → boarding, Delta1247 → flying  
Process: "New flight United892, updating existing Delta1247"
State:  United892 = {state: "boarding", updates: 1}
        Delta1247 = {state: "flying", updates: 2}
Output: United892 is boarding (1 update)
        Delta1247 is flying (2 updates)
```

### Batch 3: State Persists!
```
Input:  Southwest5031 → boarding, United892 → flying
Process: "Delta1247 not in this batch, but its state is preserved!"
State:  Southwest5031 = {state: "boarding", updates: 1}  
        United892 = {state: "flying", updates: 2}
        Delta1247 = {state: "flying", updates: 2} ← Still there!
```

**Key insight**: Delta1247's state survived even though it wasn't in batch 3!

## 🔧 The Code Structure

### 1. FlightProcessor (learn_tws.py)
```python
class FlightProcessor(StatefulProcessor):
    def handleInputRows(self, key: str, rows: Iterator[pd.DataFrame], timerValues: Any) -> Iterator[pd.DataFrame]:
        """
        Process flight updates for one flight.
        
        Args:
            key: The flight identifier (e.g., "Delta1247")
            rows: Iterator of DataFrames containing flight state updates
            timerValues: Timer information (not used in this example)
            
        Returns:
            Iterator[pd.DataFrame]: Iterator containing result DataFrame with flight state info
        """
        # 1. Get current state for this flight
        # 2. Process new updates  
        # 3. Validate state transitions
        # 4. Update state
        # 5. Return results
```

### 2. Data Generation (learn_util.py)
```python
# Create 3 flights cycling through states
rate_stream.selectExpr(
    """CASE (value % 3)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Delta1247'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'United892'  
        ELSE 'Southwest5031'
    END as flight""",
    
    """CASE (value % 3)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'boarding'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'flying'
        ELSE 'landed'  
    END as state"""
)
```

### 3. Main Demo (learn_main.py)
```python
def main() -> None:
    """
    Simple main function - no complex menus or options.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Just run the demo - keep it simple!
    # python learn_main.py            # See it running
```

## 💻 Code Quality Features

### Learning-Friendly Standards
All code follows good Python practices:

- **🔍 Type Hints**: Every function parameter and return type is specified
- **📝 Comprehensive Docstrings**: All functions include detailed parameter documentation
- **🎯 Clear Examples**: Function signatures show exactly what to expect

### Example of Good Documentation
```python
def create_flight_data(spark: SparkSession) -> DataFrame:
    """
    Create simple flight data stream.
    
    Args:
        spark: The Spark session to use for creating the stream
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame: A streaming DataFrame with flight state updates
    """
```

This makes the code:
- ✅ **Easier to understand** - Clear parameter descriptions
- ✅ **IDE-friendly** - Auto-completion and type checking
- ✅ **Well-documented** - Good documentation standards
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** - Learn good practices from the start

## 🎯 Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Watch State Persistence
1. Run `python learn_main.py`
2. Watch the console output
3. Notice how the same flight's `update_count` increases over time
4. **Key insight**: State survives between batches!

### Exercise 2: Understand Validation  
1. Look at the `_is_valid_transition()` method in `learn_tws.py`
2. See how we prevent invalid moves (like boarding → landed)
3. Watch the console for "❌ Invalid transition" messages

### Exercise 3: Follow One Flight
1. Pick one flight (like Delta1247)
2. Track its journey through the console output
3. See: boarding → flying → landed → boarding (cycle)

## 🔍 Key Learning Points

### 1. Grouping by Key
```python
.groupBy("flight")  # Each flight processed separately
```
- Delta1247 gets its own processing
- United892 gets its own processing  
- Southwest5031 gets its own processing

### 2. State Storage
```python
self.flight_state = handle.getValueState("flight_state", schema)
```
- Each flight has independent state
- State includes current status and update count
- Survives between streaming batches

### 3. Batch Processing
```python
def handleInputRows(self, key, rows, timerValues):
    # Called once per flight per batch
    # 'key' = flight name (Delta1247, United892, Southwest5031)
    # 'rows' = all updates for this flight in this batch
```

### 4. State Validation
```python
def _is_valid_transition(self, from_state, to_state):
    # boarding → flying ✅
    # flying → landed ✅  
    # boarding → landed ❌
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'pyspark'"
```bash
pip install pyspark pandas
```

### Spark warnings about native libraries
These are normal - just performance optimizations. Ignore them for learning.

### StateStore errors
This is a known Spark limitation with certain versions. The concepts still work perfectly for learning!
